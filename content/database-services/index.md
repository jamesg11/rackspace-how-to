This series of articles provides an introduction to NoSQL databases, and
explains the differences between NoSQL databases and relational databases.
You can organize databases of both types so that a database management system
can access and pull specific information from them. The articles touch on
commonly used relational database management systems (RDBMSs), such as Oracle
Database, and popular NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB and Cassandra.

These articles are intended to help you identify areas where you can best
leverage an RDBMS or a NoSQL database. Rackspace Application Services (RAS)
supports most currently available databases. Learn more about [Rackspace Application Services](https://www.rackspace.com/en-us/application-services).
